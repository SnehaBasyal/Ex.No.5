## EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

### Date:

### Reg no: 212222240101

### Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus 
basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios. Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 


### AI Tool Used:

ChatGPT

### Procedure:

1. Selected four scenarios:
   
    • Generating a creative story
   
    • Answering a factual question
   
    • Summarising a concept
   
    • Providing advice/recommendations
   
3. For each scenario, created a **naïve prompt** (broad, unstructured) and a **refined prompt** (clear, detailed, structured).
   
4. Ran both prompts through ChatGPT and recorded the responses.
   
5. Compared outputs on quality, accuracy, and depth.

### Results – ChatGPT Outputs:

### Evaluation Scores (out of 5):

| Scenario                 | Quality (Naïve / Refined) | Accuracy (Naïve / Refined) | Depth (Naïve / Refined) |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Creative Story           | 2 / 5                     | 2 / 5                      | 1 / 5                   |
| Factual Question         | 3 / 5                     | 5 / 5                      | 2 / 5                   |
| Summarising Concept      | 2 / 5                     | 5 / 5                      | 2 / 5                   |
| Advice / Recommendations | 1 / 5                     | 5 / 5                      | 1 / 5                   |


### Analysis:

* Naïve prompts gave short, generic answers without context or examples.
* Refined prompts generated longer, detailed, scenario-specific outputs, often including examples, moral lessons or actionable steps.
* The improvement was most dramatic for creative and advice scenarios. Even in factual questions, structured prompts ensured bullet points and relevant examples.


### Result: 
The prompt for the above said problem executed successfully
